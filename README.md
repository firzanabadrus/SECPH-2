## [SECI 1143 - Probability & Statistical Data Analysis](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-2/tree/main/SECI1143%20-%20Probability%20%26%20Statistical%20Data%20Analysis)
This course introduces basic statistical techniques for data analysis. Students will start by learning about different types of data from various sources, such as daily activities and industrial processes. The course covers visual data representation, methods for estimating parameters from different distributions, and hypothesis testing. By the end, students will be able to apply statistical models to analyze data using software tools.

## [SECJ 1023 - Programming Techniques 2](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-2/tree/main/SECJ1023%20-%20Programming%20Techniques%202)
This course introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) using C++. It teaches both the theory and practice of solving problems with an object-oriented approach, focusing on key concepts like encapsulation, associations, and inheritance. By the end of the course, students will be able to use OOP techniques to solve problems.

## [SECP 2613 - System Analysis & Design (WBL)](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-2/tree/main/SECP2613%20-%20System%20Analysis%20%26%20Design%20(WBL))
This course focuses on teaching students practical skills in systems analysis and design using a structured approach. Students will learn to assess information system requirements within an organizational context. The course is organized into phases: planning, analysis, design, and implementation. Based on the outputs from the planning and analysis phases, students will create input, output, and interface designs. They will work on a project to develop a database application system for a selected organization, collaborating closely with the organization throughout the analysis, design, and implementation stages. By the end of the course, students will be able to design and develop effective information systems for real-world problems.

## [SECR 1033 - Computer Organization & Architecture](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-2/tree/main/SECR1033%20-%20Computer%20Organization%20%26%20Architecture%20)
This course provides an understanding of the basic concepts of computer organization and architecture. It covers topics such as computer performance, data types and representation, arithmetic operations, instruction execution, micro-programmed control memory, pipelining, memory, input/output, and instruction formats. By the end of the course, students will understand the overall components of a computer and recognize current technologies in computer hardware.

## [SECV 2113 - Human Computer Interaction](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-2/tree/main/SECV2113%20-%20Human%20Computer%20Interaction)
This course introduces students to human-computer interaction (HCI) theories and design processes, with a focus on applied user experience (UX) design. It presents an evaluation-centered UX lifecycle that includes usability, usefulness, and emotional impact. The UX lifecycle is a flexible template that can be adapted to different development projects. Key activities covered include contextual inquiry and analysis, requirements extraction, design-informing models, design thinking, ideation, sketching, conceptual design, and formative evaluation.

## [ULRS 1182 - Appreciation of Ethics & Civilizations](https://github.com/firzanabadrus/SECPH-2/tree/main/ULRS1182%20-%20Appreciation%20of%20Ethics%20%26%20Civilizations)
This course covers the basics of ethics and civilizations, focusing on the importance of ethical values in different cultures and historical settings. Students will learn about ethical theories, moral philosophies, and how civilizations have developed. The course also looks at how ethical principles have shaped societies and influenced human behavior throughout history. By the end, students should understand the role of ethics in the development of civilizations and be able to apply ethical reasoning to modern issues.
